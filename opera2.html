        <h1>Vungarala Ranjith</h1>
        <h5>Thespis</h5>   
        <h4>MER</h4>. Home at last. A nice time I've had of it.
        <h4>DIA</h4>. You young scamp you've been out all night again. This is the
        third time you've been out this week.
        <h4>MER</h4>. Well you're a nice one to blow me up for that.

        <h4>DIA</h4>. I can't help being out all night.

        <h4>MER</h4> And I can't help being down all night. The nature of Mercury
        requires that he should go down when the sun sets, and rise again
        when the sun rises.

        <h4>DIA</h4>. And what have you been doing?

        <h4>MER</h4> Stealing on commission. There's a set of false teeth and a
        box of Life Pills for Jupiter—an invisible peruke and a bottle
        of hair dye—that's for Apollo—a respirator and a pair of
        galoshes—that's for Cupid—a full bottomed chignon, some
        auricomous fluid, a box of pearl-powder, a pot of rouge, and a
        hare's foot—that's for Venus.

        <h4>DIA</h4>. Stealing. You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

        <h4>MER</h4> Oh, as the god of thieves I must do something to justify my
        position.

        <h4>DIA</h4>.and AP. <p>[contemptuously]</p> Your position.

        <h4>MER</h4>. Oh, I know it's nothing to boast of even on earth.  Up here,
        it's simply contemptible.  Now that you gods are too old for your
        work, you've made me the miserable drudge of Olympus—groom,
        valet, postman, butler, commissionaire, maid of all work, parish
        beadle, and original dustman.<br>
